\section{Introduction}

Making scientific and technical information available to the general public has always been a challenge.
Often such information, the use of which could be of enormous benefit to the public, falls on deaf ears.\\

We now have access to a new form of scientific data - 'big data' - massive numbers of data points.
This data is accumulating at enormous rates, and their is an obvious desire to use it, both for
commercial and 'public good' reasons.\\

We have ways of delivering this information that are effectively free, and can be made extremely compelling
if presented in the right way. This chapter is a guide to 'the right way'.\\

We have created a tool - Aire Guru - which collects air pollution data periodically, stores it for historical use, 
processes it to extract relevant information, personalizes it to engage the user with regard to their individual
circumstance, visualizes it in an easy to understand format, and provides it online to facilitate its accessibility. Furthermore,
descriptions of all the data and how it has been processed are also provided to raise public awareness of the value
of this data.\\

While developing Aire Guru, and later reflecting on the process and success of the project, we we motivated to codify
some of the lessons learnt in bringing somewhat dry and technical data to the general public, in a way that made it 
accessible, relevent, and compelling.\\
