\subsection*{Structure}

In this chapter we will see how to make the data accessible, relevant and compelling for 
the average user. For each one of the secluded ones, we will see the theory, as it has been applied
in the Air Guru project and its evaluation.
Next, we will see a general evaluation of these three concepts and to finish the 
obtained conclusions.
This chapter is written with the objectives we want to achieve in mind for the reusing of bigData. It means, make the 
concepts accessible, relevant and compelling. It intents to be a guide which show these principles
in its structure.
