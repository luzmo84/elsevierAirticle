\subsection{The structure of this document}

We first provide a short introduction to the Aire Guru project in order to provide context.
In the following sections, we provide a set of guidelines that can be used to make big data
accessible, relevant and compelling for the average user. Such principles are applicable to 
online products in general, but we consider them here with special reference to presenting
data, as opposed to e.g. social media sites. \\

Firstly, we deal with general preliminaries, that in a commercial context would be called
'Market Research' and 'The Business Case'. These ideas are just as applicable to the delivery of
public-good data as commercial offerings. \\

We then present 14 specific principles, classified into three categories: Accessible, Relevant, and Compelling.
Each principle is described, along with suggested strategies to achieve that goal, and we then show
how that principle is reflected in the context of our Aire Guru project. We conclude with some
general comments, and provide a suggested reading list for each major section. \\

We have applied these same principles to the design of this chapter.
