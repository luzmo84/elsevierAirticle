The steps involved in collecting, analysing and making important datasets available to the general public are well understood. \\

But how do we make such data accessible, relevent, and compelling for the average user? \\

In this chapter we provide a framework for considering this question, providing guidance and checklists, showing how we applied this framework
in the development of the Aire Guru tool developed by the first author at the International University of La Rioja, and evaluating the effectiveness
of Aire Guru with respect to the framework metrics. \\

This chapter is itself an example of the framework principles: Accessible, Relevant, and Compelling. \\
