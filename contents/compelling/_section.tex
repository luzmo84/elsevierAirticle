\section{Compelling}

To retain your users you need to bring to bear all your powers of seduction.
Users are more likely to expend time and energy on something they find attractive and compelling.
You should design your interface and data representations with this in mind, to attract users and maximize their engagement.\\

In this section we consider six questions related to making your content compelling, to attract and keep your users:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Are you solving a real problem?
    \item Can users rely on your data?
    \item Can users trust you?
    \item Are your users emotionally engaged with your data?
    \item Is your interface familiar and easy to use?
    \item Does your site look good?
\end{itemize}
