\section{Compelling}
The human being moves by the power of seduction, only if we feel attracted we will put our interest
and effort to achieve it. This shows us that in the representations we make, we will have to worry
about the effect that it transmits, the connection it has for others, more attraction, more level
of involvement on the part of the user.\\


In this section we will review the different points to implement a product that stays in mind
of the user and this is irresistibly attracted to use it.
