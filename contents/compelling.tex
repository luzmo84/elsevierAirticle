\section{Compelling}
The human being moves by the power of seduction, only if we feel attracted will we put our
interest and effort to achieve it. This shows us that in the representations that we make, we will have to
worry about the effect it transmits, the hook it has for others, more attraction, more
Level of involvement by the user. \\

The marketing departments have been studying different techniques during the last years,
so we can apply your consent to reach our users and they want to continue with us.

In this section we will review the different points to implement a product that stays in mind
of the user and this is irresistibly attracted to use it.
