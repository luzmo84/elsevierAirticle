\section{Accessible}

The data is considered accessible by the user when they do not need to make an excessive effort to
to obtain it, understand it and use it, that is, apply them to their particular situation. To achieve these objectives,
it is necessary that the user can access them in a way that is familiar and in a language and nomenclature
they can understand.\\ 

In this section we consider five questions related to making sure your data is physically and psychologically accessible:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Is your data easy to obtain?
    \item Are you putting up psychological barriers?
    \item Is your data too low-level?
    \item Does your data required too much expertise or use specialist terminology?
    \item How do potential users find out that you exist?
\end{itemize}
