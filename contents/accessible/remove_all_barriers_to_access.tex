\subsection{Remove all barriers to access}
We already told about offering the data directly to the user but going back to the concept that available
does not mean accessible. If we lock ourself and make a completly private platform, we would lose the oportunity
to bring the information to the users.\\

We break these barriers building a service free of charge, or at least as free as it can be. Of course, if we are 
working with data of third parties and they have a restricted policy, we will need to adjust the rates to cover
these restrictions.\\

It is recomendable to do not force our users to identify theirself or provide data if this is not
extrictly necesary for the proper behaviour of our data representation. As we mention before, collecting data from our
users requires a major efford to ensure their security. Furthemore, we see like every year, the laws ajust to provent
the abuse with the data of the users. If we use any user's data, we should make sure it not compromise the law.\\

All of us have noticed how annoying is to be reading an article when more than the 50\% of the information is advertising.
We problably do not want to give the same impression to our users since it can repel them to the point that they will no longer
user our tool. If we need to use this kind of tecnics to support our system, We will problably choose the right places to offer 
these advertising without interfering in the representation of our information.


\subsubsection*{Suggested strategies} 

To remove the biggest amount of barriers we will try to offer a low rate system, no force the user to provide any unjustified 
data and avoid advertising which obstructs the representation of our data.

\subsubsection*{In the context of Aire Guru \ldots} 

Aire Guru is available online completely free of charge. It requieres login, since it shows the personal records of the 
user exposure to pollution. However, all the rest of the funtionabilities are offered to all the users, identified and no 
identified.

Aire Guru does not uses publicity.
