\subsection{Know about}

No matter how optimized the representation of the data is, if users are not aware of the existence of the resource, they can not use it.

\subsubsection{How to solve it} 
The best way is to advertise the product in the appropriate environments.
\subsubsection{How we solve it. Aire Guru} 
Our tool is implemented for the city of Malaga, so we are currently working to publicize it in this city.
It is currently available in the open data portal in the app tab \footnote {\url {https://datosabiertos.malaga.eu/aplicaciones}} \\
Aire Guru participated in the first open data reuse contest organized by the Malaga City Council \footnote {\url {https://tinyurl.com/yx9wzutj}}
and was a finalist in the web page category.
