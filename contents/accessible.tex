\section{Accessible}

The data is considered accessible by the user when he does not need to make an excessive effort to
to be able to obtain them, understand them and use them, that is, apply them to their particular situation. To achieve these objectives,
it is necessary that the user can access them in a way that is familiar and in a language and nomenclature
he can understand.\\ 

So how do we consider that data is accessible to a user?
\begin{itemize}
\item When it is easy to obtain.
The data should be readily available over the web.
\item When it is easy to understand.
The data must be represented in such a way that it's meaning is clear and obvious to a non-specialist. 
Imagine a science writer explaining a complicated concept for a mass market magazine audience. Use everyday language and easily interpretable diagrams.
\item When it is easy to use.
A user must be able to apply the data to their own particular purpose without complicated procedure.
\end{itemize}



In this section we will see if it is possible to access data by an average user and how to optimize accessibility.
