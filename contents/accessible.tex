\section{Accessible}

The data is considered accessible by the user when he does not need to make an excessive effort to
to be able to obtain them, understand them and use them, that is, apply them to their particular situation. To achieve these objectives,
it is necessary that the user can access them in a way that is familiar and in a language and nomenclature
he can understand.\\ 

In this section we will see if it is possible to access data by an average user and how to optimize accessibility.
