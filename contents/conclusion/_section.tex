\section{General Comments}

Of course, every project is individual, with its own particular circumstance and constraints. Not all
the principles we have outlined will apply equally to every project. In any case, the principles are
quite general, but we think they provide a reasonable framework to help bring datasources to the public
and maximize their effectiveness.\\

Aire Guru is a work in progress, and is certainly not perfect. Nor does it yet completely follow the principles
that we have given in this chapter.\\

In the final section you will find a reading list, organised according to these principles, that you
can use to go deeper into these concepts.\\
