The steps involved in collecting, analysing and making important datasets available to the general public are well understood. \\

But how do we make such data accessible, relevent, and compelling for the average user?. \\

In this chapter we provide a framework for considering this question, providing guidance and checklists,
and show how we applied this framework in the development of the Aire Guru website developed by the first
author at the International University of La Rioja. \\

We also use the framework to evaluate the effectiveness of Aire Guru in creating awareness of air pollution and its effects. \\

This chapter is itself an example of the framework principles: Accessible, Relevant, and Compelling. \\
