\section{Relevant}

In this section we consider three questions related to making sure your data is relevant to your users:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Are you overwhelming your user with irrelvencies?
    \item What are the real-life consequences that your data indicates?
    \item Is your data customized for each user?
\end{itemize}
